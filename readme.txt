Update Notes:

* LifeStream v0.3 extensions are NOT compatible with v0.2 or v0.1. You also will need to reactivate the plugin when upgrading from v0.1, as the database has changed.
* When updating to 0.38 you will need to remove your Last.fm feed and re-add it as the data structure has been completely changed. (First non-rss lifestream feed!)
* LifeStream v0.6 extensions have newly added support for multi-user which introduces two new LABEL constants that you must add to your custom code.

== Installation ==

Upload the plugin (unzipped) into `/wp-content/plugins/`. You should end up with `/wp-content/plugins/lifestream/lifestream.php`.

Activate the plugin under the "Plugins" menu.

Visit "LifeStream" -> "Settings" to configure the basic options, and add feeds.

There are severals methods in which you can use LifeStream in a WordPress page.

The easiest way is to use the normal context handler (works in pages and posts):

`[lifestream]`

Another method requires a [custom WordPress page](http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages#Page_Templates), or the use of a template, and is a simple function call:

`<?php lifestream(); ?>`

* Note: arguments passed must be as an array with key/value pairs.

You may also specify several parameters in the `lifestream` method (useful for sidebar display):

* `(int) number_of_items`: defaults to '50'
* `(array) feed_ids`: defaults to all feeds
* `(string) date_interval`: defaults to '1 month'
* `(string) output`: defaults to table; options are table and list

For example:

`[lifestream number_of_items="10" output="list"]`

For more advanced uses, you may directly use `lifestream_get_events()` which will return an array of `Event` instances.

Example:

`<ul>
<?php
$events = lifestream_get_events(array('number_of_items' => 50));

foreach ($events as $event)
{
	echo '<li>'.$event->render().'</li>';
}
?>
</ul>`
